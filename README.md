👋 Hi, I’m Anan Javed Mohammad, an Analytics & Data Science professional with over 6 years of experience building data products, designing experiments, and applying statistical rigor to solve complex business and product challenges. I love transforming raw data into meaningful insights that guide product innovation, marketing strategies, and organizational decision-making.

💻 My technical toolkit includes Python, SQL, Apache Spark, and cloud platforms like Google Cloud Platform (BigQuery, BQML, Vertex AI, Composer) and Databricks. I’m passionate about applying regression, forecasting, causal inference, and A/B experimentation to answer real-world questions, while tools like Tableau, Alteryx, and Power BI help me tell compelling data stories.

🚀 Currently, I’m a Senior Consultant at Deloitte, where I develop profitability data cubes, scenario planning tools, and dashboards that inform pre-merger due diligence. I’ve also built program costing models integrating P&L and enrollment data, using scenario-driven experimentation to help stakeholders explore different profitability outcomes.

📊 Previously, as a Senior Data Analyst at Home Depot Canada, I automated customer segmentation across billions of POS and clickstream records, developed predictive models for renovation behavior, and designed rigorous A/B experiments for recommendation engines. I also led analysis of post-pandemic consumer behavior, shaping new marketing strategies. In earlier roles as a Business & Supply Chain Analyst, I optimized delivery logic to cut transportation costs by 46% and rolled out a nationwide delivery management system.

🔧 My journey started as a Designer Analyst at Husky, where I applied simulations and experiments to design innovative, cost-effective mechanical parts. Along the way, I earned a Master of Management Analytics from Queen’s University and a Bachelor of Chemical Engineering from the University of Toronto, plus certifications including Google Generative AI Leader and a Certificate in Data Science from BrainStation.

🌐 Always exploring the evolving world of data science, experimentation, and cloud analytics, I’m driven by curiosity and collaboration. Let’s connect on LinkedIn
 and share data-driven adventures!
